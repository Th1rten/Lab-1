  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p>Hi my name is Juan Garcia and I want to learn how to code. I am going to keep this short and simple, but most of the stuff I like is video games, anime, and learning how to code.</p>
  <p>Another thing about me is I like to collect comic books and like to work at the Logan Threater.</p>
